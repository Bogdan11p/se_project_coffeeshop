Title of the project: Practicum Coffee Shop

This project required making a website from scratch for a coffee shop. In this website you can find the menu and all the prices, a recipe page where you can try it on your own, and a fill-out form where you can reserve a table for you and your family or friends so that you can try the products the coffee shop has.

In order to complete this project I used HTML and CSS. In HTML I used many BEM blocks and BEM nesting. For CSS I implemented different styles, key frames and animations, and pseudo classes.
